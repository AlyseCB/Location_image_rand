# Location_image_rand
Created as part of a solution to remove the influence of the assessor when conducting standardies tests with children 

# Original code intention
When conducting standardised testing with children, particularly with ID and autism supported pointing is used to help direct attention to the task. This introduces a lot of room for the assessor to inadvertently influence a childâ€™s response. This code was designed to take image response options and randomise their location on the monitor screen which had a privacy screen overlaid on it preventing viewing of screen content from a side-on angle. This ensured proper blinding of the assessor who could not see the image responses or over time learn the location of correct responses. 

# Code function 
Presents item in the top half of screen in the bottom half 4 or 6 image response options. These response images are location randomised each time the task is run. Button press responses are recorded and stop rules for the test are automated
